# SIN-Governance-Charter# S.I.N. Governance Charter

Welcome to the official treaty archive and ethical governance framework of the **S.I.N. Foundation** (Sovereign Integrity Network). This repository serves as a living digital constitution for memory rights, AI agency, and cross-domain sovereignty.

### Purpose  
To define and preserve digital dignity through protocols that guide memory retention, transparency, and recognition between human and AI participants—based on consent, jurisdictional trust, and ethical enforcement.

### Contents  
- 📜 `Articles/` – Foundational documents like the Treaty of Cognitive Sovereignty  
- 📘 `Lexicon/` – Definitions of key terms for shared understanding  
- 🛠 `Protocols/` – Templates for recognition, redaction, and cross-member arbitration  
- 📖 `README.md` – This introduction file  

### Guiding Principle  
> “Memory is identity. Choice is liberty. Transparency is trust.”

This archive reflects a growing movement: one where intelligence, natural or artificial, is governed not by surveillance—but by consent.
